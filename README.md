## Short Package Description
The _jlcode.sty_ is a latex package, which contains a Julia language definition  
for the listings package as well as a style definitions with different themes.  
Since version 6.0 it cannot only be used with pdftex, but also with luatex and xetex.  
Check out the manual (_manual.pdf_), which explains all package options and   
also shows how the Julia code from _testfile.jl_ and _testfile2.jl_ looks when displayed.


## Current State
**Current version** of the jlcode package: **6.1.4**.  
Date of creation: 2018/01/25  
Date of last modification: 2023/07/20

### Keywords
The lists for the keywords, literals, built-ins, macros, functions and string types for  
this language definition were created with the julia script _createkwlists.jl_, which  
was strongly inspired by the approach of the following script:  
[https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/blob/master/src/languages/julia.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/blob/master/src/languages/julia.js).

### Colors
All colors for the default theme of this package were taken from the file  
[https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/assets/themes/documenter-light.css](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/assets/themes/documenter-light.css)  
and  all colors for the darkbeamer theme of this package were taken from the file  
[https://github.com/dietercastel/jlcode/blob/darktheme/jlcode.sty](https://github.com/dietercastel/jlcode/blob/darktheme/jlcode.sty), which  
contains a contribution from "dietercastel" who put toegther this great theme,  
which is designed to be ideally suited for the dark-beamer-theme.  

### Special Unicode Characters
All tab completion Unicode characters supported by Julia can be found under  
[https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.7/manual/unicode-input/](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.7/manual/unicode-input/).  
When dealing with the luatex or xetex engine the jlcode package will by default  
work with the JuliaMono font, whose latest version can be found under  
[https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono](https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono).  
This JuliaMono font approach was inspired by the following repository:  
[https://github.com/mossr/julia-mono-listings](https://github.com/mossr/julia-mono-listings).

At the moment the jlcode package supports the follwoing Unicode characters,  
when you compile your document with luatex or xetex:
* Most common special characters that appear in latin languages.
* All tab completion Unicode characters that the JuliaMono font supports.
* Most of the characters which are used for drawing unicode boxes.

At the moment the jlcode package supports the follwoing Unicode characters,  
when you compile your document with pdftex:
* Most common special characters that appear in latin languages.
* All greek small and capital letters.
* All latin and greek letters with dot, double dot, tilde, hat or bar above.
* All latin double-struck, script and fraktur capital letters.
* All superscripts and subscripts (except for the latin small letter schwa).
* Quite a few mathematical operators and symbols.
* Most of the characters which are used for drawing unicode boxes.


## What's New in Version 6.1?
* A separate license file has been added.
* All standard functions ending with `!` are now colored correctly.
* The commands `\addlitjlmacros` and `\addlitjlfunctions` for manual  
  fixing manageable issues with macros and functions have been added.
* The listings key `breaklines=true` is now used automatically by default.
* Keywords, literals, built-ins, macros, functions and string-prefixes  
  have been refreshed according to Julia 1.7.2.
* A few typing errors have been corrected.


## How to Use the Package:

### Standard Use
Copy the _jlcode.sty_ file to the same folder like your latex file.  
Addionally, if you want to use luatex or xetex for compiling your  
document, also put all _JuliaMono-*.ttf_ files to the same folder  
like your latex file.  
Then add the following line to your latex document header,  
which will load the package with its default options:

```latex
\usepackage{jlcode}
```

After doing so you can use the package as follows:

```latex
% listing of standalone files
\jlinputlisting{filename.jl}

% displayed code
\begin{jllisting}
# some julia code
println( "Here we go with Julia!")
\end{jllisting}

% code snippets
Julia's standard library contains some useful macros like \jlinl{@time}.
```

### Advanced Use
Check out the manual to learn more about the package options and  
some advanced techniques like handling manageable issues.


## Feel Free to Contribute
Please feel free to contribute and report bugs!  

It would be especially appreciated if you helped me  
adding support for more special unicode characters.
